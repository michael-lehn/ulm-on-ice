## Purpose

Some simple IO mirror. You can use a program like C-Kermit to "communicate"
via the serial port with the FPGA. You will see in the `C-Kermit` console what
you have typed in. In addition the Hex display shows the last byte that was
received by the FPGA. The repository contains `kermit-serial` which I have
copied to `$HOME/bin`.
