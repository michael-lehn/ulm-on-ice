# Pupose

Provide an additional target for the compiler class project in 
[HPC0](https://www.mathematik.uni-ulm.de/numerik/hpc/ss22/hpc0/index.html)
next semester.

## What is ULM on ICE?

It is a simple implementation of the ULM (Ulm Lecture Machine) on a
[iCEBreaker FPGA](https://1bitsquared.com/products/icebreaker).

## Current state

It's a working prototype, and it's is doing what it was designed for. When I
started the project it was my first encounter with `Verilog` and
`SystemVerilog` and the first time I had an FPGA in my hands. This means that
there is lots of potential for improvement. And if time permits I will do so.

If you are also a newbie you might be interested in places where you find some
information on getting started:
- [Project F](https://projectf.io)
- [Verilator introduction](https://itsembedded.com/dhd/verilator_1/)
- [SystemVerilog tutorial](https://www.chipverify.com/systemverilog/systemverilog-tutorial)
- ... I will extend and comment this list ...
