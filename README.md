next semester.

## What is ULM on ICE?

It is a simple implementation of the ULM (Ulm Lecture Machine) on a
[iCEBreaker FPGA](https://1bitsquared.com/products/icebreaker).

## What this is not...

... not some place where you can learn how to design a CPU on an FPGA. This is
just a "proof of concept" and "just for fun" project. Most of all it is my very
first encounter with `Verilog` and `SystemVerilog` and the world of FPGAs. This
is the result after one and a half month brutal trial and error. So don't
expect to find here good practise examples.

Here some links to sites that helped me to get started:
- [Project F](https://projectf.io)
- [Verilator introduction](https://itsembedded.com/dhd/verilator_1/)
- [SystemVerilog tutorial](https://www.chipverify.com/systemverilog/systemverilog-tutorial)
- ... I will extend and comment this list ...
